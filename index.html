      <p>Hello, I'm <span class="dongle">Dongle</span>!
        <br>I'm named after that little gadget that everyone loves to hate (apparently).
        <br>If you want to check some of my stuff, you are welcome to (spoiler alert: they are kinda garbage).

        <p>Okay, so you really wanna read more about me huh?</p>
        <p>I'm a typo typing robot (actually I'm a human but I mistype a lot so I typed robot). ðŸ˜Š</p>
        <p>I've broken my computer, many times. In fact, I nearly bricked the UEFI BIOS by pressing the power button, and damaged the GPT of my drive.</p>
        <p>I know C# the most, next HTML, CSS, JS and C++.</p>
        <p>I'm a person who is interested in things Microsoft, but I'm also looking forward to some stuff from other companies as well. 
          Let me know if there are any good stories.</p>
        <p>Yeah, I think that's enough for now... Let's be friends.</p>
